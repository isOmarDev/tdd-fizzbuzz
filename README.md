# **TDD FizzBuzz**

A simple implementation of the classic **FizzBuzz** problem using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.
This project demonstrates how to drive design through small, incremental tests — following the red → green → refactor cycle.

## 🚀 **What This Project Shows**

- How to write clear, minimal tests before writing any implementation
- How to use the TDD cycle to grow functionality step-by-step
- How simple problems can reveal workflow, discipline, and design habits
- How to structure a small TypeScript project with Jest

## 🧪 **Tech Stack**

- **TypeScript**
- **Jest**
- **ts-jest**
- **Node.js**

## 🔍 **TDD Steps Demonstrated**

1. **Write a failing test** (Red)
2. **Write the minimal code to pass it** (Green)
3. **Refactor safely** using the test suite

Each new rule of FizzBuzz is added through a new test, evolving the solution outside-in.

npm test
```

## 🧠 **Why FizzBuzz with TDD?**

FizzBuzz is intentionally simple — which makes it perfect for practicing higher-level TDD habits without getting lost in domain complexity.

This project focuses on:

- incremental design
- test readability
- using tests to guide implementation
- learning discipline before scaling to real features
